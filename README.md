# C_Sharp-Rest-API
Over the duration of the associates degree college education. Students were tasked with creating a program for the final assignment of many programming courses. At the time I completed this assignment for a C# course, it was a standalone program. As I grew conceptually and with programmatical skills. I decided to extend the program with a REST API built on top of it. 

What you will see is the C# code for the program of the final assignment. Any future commits will either re-structure the design pattern of the program or


Next Stages of the Program
---------------------------
1. ADD a MySQL Database as the backend of the program. This will include SQL queries and Stored Procedures. 
2. ADD either an Angular.js or REACT.js Front End to communicate with the REST API.
